# Clust
For the project implementation we have utilised the Python programming language as well as MS SQL for the data integration tool that has been based on two hundred tables populated by data obtained from a telecommunication company. Furthermore, data preprocessing was done using SQL and additional processing was done using Python. Django has been utilized as the framework to be used for the implementation of the client application which consists of a login page as well as an additional page with the search functionality for users and clusters.
